# Cyber-Apocalypse-CTF-2022-WriteUp
This is my first time joining CTFs and I was playing it on my own. I did practice a bit on THM, PicoCTF and natas some months ago though.

## Reflections
I enrolled after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yifUeRFXgaE) from John Hammond's Youtube channel and I was like it's free so why not. This is a very valuable experience - I learnt a lot about digital forensics and some web and binary skills as well, though I could have done some research (esp. RAID 5 disk, email formats) better.

## Declaration
All the tools deployed were solely for Capture The Flag events and I have absolutely no intention to imperil the security of any machine that is not a part of the CTF challenge. The end goal of joining CTFs is to enrich my ability as a developer. The knowledge disclosed here are not to be used in any illegal activity and you are responsible for your own actions.
