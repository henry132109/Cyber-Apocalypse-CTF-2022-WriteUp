## Skills involved: Using Logic Analyzer, guessing

I am generally unfamiliar with hardware stuffs so it's surprising that I could even solve one.

The file is used by [Saleae Logic Analyser](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/). There are many ways to interpret binary data pulses, like the less technical Morse code and bar code or binary ASCII.
But the phrase *"They must have known that our equipment can read even the slightest fluctuations"* basically bars them out.

Notice the pulse width (duration signal stays high) is in ASCII range milliseconds long. The first few pulses can be analyzed to conclude on the correct method: flooring the duration. That gives **Coordinates**.

By analyzing in reverse I skipped all the chit-chats and got the flag.
